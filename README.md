# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name's Nate and I'm a full stack software engineer mainly working with web technologies. I've been an engineer at start ups, in government institutions, and Fortune 500 companies. My last role was building and maintaining the [web app](https://natedelacruz.com/weightwatchers) for WeightWatchers.

Here's a link to my [portfolio](https://natedelacruz.com/) and here's my [resume](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/react-portfolio-944de.appspot.com/o/Resume%20Nate%20De%20La%20Cruz.pdf?alt=media&token=a0a7d56f-07ac-4835-8729-14d93b5987b7).

The following repos are some samples of my work.

# [Cut ups](https://github.com/64bit-polygon/cut_ups/blob/main/README.md)

Cut ups is a multipurpose word processor web app built with `react`, `recoil`, and `firebase`. The user creates text compositions in one of two ways: they can start from a blank page (the traditional method) or they can use the â€˜cut up techniqueâ€™ (ala William Burroughs) where two sources are folded together to create a new text. The document can be edited, styled, saved, shared, and downloaded.

# [My portfolio](https://github.com/64bit-polygon/portfolio/blob/main/README.md)

This is my portfolio built with `react`, `recoil`, and `firebase`. It features several thumbnail `.svg` animations to illustrate various projects I've worked on along with screen recording and descriptions.

# [raven-writer](https://github.com/64bit-polygon/raven-writer/blob/main/README.md)

`raven-writer` is a FE utility to allow for easy translations and interpolations for projects using the popular [POEditor](https://poeditor.com/) localization service.

What `raven-writer` does:

- GETs and caches localizations for your project
- Refreshes those localizations at a given interval
- Transforms simple markdown in your content into HTML strings
- Allows for dynamic interpolation of string values into your content
- Easily gets values by term

Here's the project on `npm`: [`raven-writer`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/raven-writer)

`npm`, `localizations`, `FE`

# [raven-rookery](https://github.com/64bit-polygon/raven-rookery/blob/main/README.md)

`raven-rookery` is a backend tool to get localizations from the [POEditor](https://poeditor.com/) localization service. `raven-rookery` gets and stores your localizations in memory, refreshing them at a given interval. It also provides an optional customizable API to get these localizations from whatever endpoint. By using `raven-rookery` one no longer needs to be concerned about throttling, queuing and rate limiting by hitting the POEditor endpoints directly.

Here's the project on `npm`: [`raven-rookery`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/raven-rookery)

`npm`, `localizations`, `BE`, `API`

# [iOS texting replica](https://github.com/64bit-polygon/endless_texts/blob/main/README.md)

This is a replica of iOS iMessage UI using only web technologies. I wanted to demonstrate the power of basic web technologies to create an app like experience. The animations are all css and the project is built using react.

# [recipe suggestion chatbot ðŸ¤–ðŸ’¬ðŸ¥—](https://github.com/64bit-polygon/chat_bot)

In 2023, I led a team in a company-wide hack-a-thon at WeightWatchers that won first place. Utilizing the WeightWatchers DB, it suggested WW recipes based on user input and created full recipes on the fly the user could save. It also populated any missing images in search results with DALL-E.
