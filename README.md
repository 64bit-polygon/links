# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

Some of the repos on my github account are set to private.

You'll be able to access all of my github repos (public and private) via the links below<sup>*</sup>.

They are listed from most to least recent.

# [translate()](https://gitfront.io/r/64bitpolygon/fRZT7g7MQUCc/Chat/)

My client has a website that is present in multiple markets which multiple languages. The translations are available as key value pairs. The task was to build a util that could take in a key and render a react element with the correct translation, markdown, and dynamic text interpolation, among other things.

`JS`, `React`, `Node.js`


***
<sub>* : These links point to repos on gitfront generated from my github acct `64bit-polygon`. This is bc you cannot share share private repos on github via a link. gitfront is a service that faciliates that.</sub>
