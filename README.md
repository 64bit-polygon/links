# [recipe suggestion chatbot ðŸ¤–ðŸ’¬ðŸ¥—](https://gitfront.io/r/64bitpolygon/cCX6dt9xwT83/chatbot/)

This is the FE portion (I was the sole FE dev) of a hack-a-thon winning chatbot project using ChatGPT that I led. Utilizing the WeightWatchers DB, it suggests WW meals and creates full WW recipes on the fly a member can save. It also populates any missing images with DALL-E. <a href="https://nate-de-la-cruz.dev/chatbot.mp4" target="_blank">Here's recording</a> of it.

# [translate()](https://gitfront.io/r/64bitpolygon/yw624XoeUEDB/translate/)

My client has a website that is present in multiple markets which multiple languages. The translations are available as key value pairs. The task was to build a util that could take in a key and render a react element with the correct translation, markdown, and dynamic text interpolation, among other things.

# [translations_service](https://gitfront.io/r/64bitpolygon/tXAobqD7T9BT/translations_service/)

This is a translations BE microservice. The 3rd party translations platform we use needs the data to be normalized and the fetching requires a lot of boilerplate. As teams across multiple platforms need the translations, this service reduces boilerplate, does the normalizing before it's sent, and keeps the data fresh.

`API`, `Back end`, `JS`, `Node.js`

# [system_quiz](https://gitfront.io/r/64bitpolygon/hi2J4J1u7tzT/system_quiz/)

A few years ago, I was tasked with building an assessment for a major weight and food tracking app. The assessment would suggest one of three personalized plans to the user and provide onboarding. On top of running on the browser this project was piped into iOS and Android apps via web view so it had to have a native look and feel. This code renders that assessment in react, with their responses being stored in redux.

# [descrambler](https://gitfront.io/r/64bitpolygon/dPk2qD9FfArK/descrambler/)

This is a simple descrambler I made as part of a coding assessment for a potential employer several years ago. To descramble the initial message, click "descramble". You can then put any chunk of text into the textarea to create a scrambled message. You can see the live version [here](https://nate-de-la-cruz.dev/descrambler/).

`JS`, `HTML`, `CSS`

# [Cut ups](https://gitfront.io/r/64bitpolygon/Pm3rUJnexE78/cut_ups/)

A multipurpose word processor web app. A text is created by starting from a blank page or by using the cut up technique where two sources are split into strips one line long and then shuffled together to create a new text. In doing so, strange and poetic coincidences arise. The doc can be edited, styled, saved, shared, and downloaded. <a href="https://nate-de-la-cruz.dev/cut_ups/" target="_blank">Here's recording</a> of it.
