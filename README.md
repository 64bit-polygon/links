# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

Some of the repos on my github account are set to private.

You'll be able to access all of my github repos (public and private) via the links below<sup>*</sup>.

They are listed from most to least recent.

# [recipe suggestion chatbot ðŸ¤–ðŸ’¬ðŸ¥—](https://gitfront.io/r/64bitpolygon/cCX6dt9xwT83/chatbot/)

This is the FE portion (I was the sole FE dev) of a hack-a-thon winning chatbot project using ChatGPT that I led. Utilizing the WeightWatchers DB, it suggests WW meals and creates full WW recipes on the fly a member can save. It also populates any missing images with DALL-E.

# [translate()](https://gitfront.io/r/64bitpolygon/yw624XoeUEDB/translate/)

My client has a website that is present in multiple markets which multiple languages. The translations are available as key value pairs. The task was to build a util that could take in a key and render a react element with the correct translation, markdown, and dynamic text interpolation, among other things.
