# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

The following repos contain some samples of my work.

Since 2018 I've been a software engineer at WeightWatchers. Unfortunately the work I've done there has been closed source and so I can't can't share code samples from them.

In lieu of the code, the first 4 items listed are in-depth descriptions of major projects I've been the sole or lead engineer on while at WW. By clicking into them you'll get a more detailed description of each project.

They are listed from most to least recent.

# [recipe suggestion chatbot ðŸ¤–ðŸ’¬ðŸ¥—](https://github.com/64bit-polygon/chat_bot)

In 2023, I led a team in a company-wide hack-a-thon at WeightWatchers that won first place. Utilizing the WeightWatchers DB, it suggested WW recipes based on user input and created full recipes on the fly the user could save. It also populated any missing images in search results with DALL-E. <a href="https://nate-de-la-cruz.dev/chatbot.mp4" target="_blank">Here's recording</a> of it.

`JS`, `React`, `Node.js`, `SCSS`, `Front end`

# [ApplangaJS()](https://github.com/64bit-polygon/ApplangaJS)

The web app that I build and maintain is present in multiple markets which multiple languages. The translations are available as key value pairs. The task was to build a util that could take in a key and render a react element with the correct translation, markdown, and dynamic text interpolation, among other things.

`JS`, `React`, `Node.js`

# [Applanga Service](https://github.com/64bit-polygon/Applanga-Service)

This is a translations BE microservice. The 3rd party translations platform we use needs the data to be normalized and the fetching requires a lot of boilerplate. As teams across multiple platforms need the translations, this service reduces boilerplate, does the normalizing before it's sent, and keeps the data fresh.

`API`, `Back end`, `JS`, `Node.js`

# [program_assessment](https://github.com/64bit-polygon/program_assessment)

A few years ago, I was tasked with building an assessment while at WeightWatchers. The assessment would suggest one of three personalized plans to the user and provide onboarding. On top of running on the browser this project was piped into `iOS` and `Android` apps via web view so it had to have a native look and feel. The assessment was built in react, with their responses being stored in redux.

`React`, `Redux`, `Front end`, `JS`, `SCSS`

# [descrambler](https://github.com/64bit-polygon/descrambler)

This is a simple descrambler I made as part of a coding assessment for a potential employer several years ago. To descramble the initial message, click "descramble". You can then put any chunk of text into the textarea to create a scrambled message. You can see the live version [here](https://nate-de-la-cruz.dev/descrambler/).

`JS`, `HTML`, `CSS`

# [Cut ups](https://github.com/64bit-polygon/cut_ups)

A multipurpose word processor web app. A text is created by starting from a blank page or by using the cut up technique where two sources are split into strips one line long and then shuffled together to create a new text. In doing so, strange and poetic coincidences arise. The doc can be edited, styled, saved, shared, and downloaded. <a href="https://nate-de-la-cruz.dev/cut_ups/" target="_blank">Here's recording</a> of it.

`PHP`, `JS`, `HTML`, `CSS`

# [Fresh links](https://github.com/64bit-polygon/fresh_links)

Fresh links was a cloud-based RSS reader built with WordPress. The userâ€™s posts appeared in a timeline and are stripped free of ads, superfluous HTML, and with their full text. The articles could be automatically deleted after a user set amount of time, listed in the timeline indefinitely, or saved into a separate section. <a href="https://nate-de-la-cruz.dev/fresh_links/" target="_blank">Here's recording</a> of it.
