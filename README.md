# Hello! 👋

Some of the repos on my github account are set to private.

You'll be able to access all of my github repos (public and private) via the links below<sup><sup>§</sup></sup>.

They are listed from most to least recent.


***
<sub>§: These links point to repos on gitfront generated from my github acct `64bit-polygon`. This is bc you cannot share share private repos on github via a link. gitfront is a service that faciliates that.</sub>
