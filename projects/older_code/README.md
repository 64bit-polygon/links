# Some older projects

The following repos contain some samples of my work.

Since 2018 I've been a software engineer at WeightWatchers. Unfortunately the work I've done there has been closed source and so I can't can't share code samples from them.

In lieu of the code, the first 4 items listed are in-depth descriptions of major projects I've been the sole or lead engineer on while at WW. By clicking into them you'll get a more detailed description of each project.

They are listed from most to least recent.

Fresh links was a cloud-based RSS reader built with WordPress. The userâ€™s posts appeared in a timeline and are stripped free of ads, superfluous HTML, and with their full text. The articles could be automatically deleted after a user set amount of time, listed in the timeline indefinitely, or saved into a separate section. <a href="https://nate-de-la-cruz.dev/fresh_links/" target="_blank">Here's recording</a> of it.
